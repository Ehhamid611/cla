# DFINITY Contributor License Agreement
This repository holds the [CLA](https://github.com/dfinity/cla/blob/main/CLA.md) document for the organisation as well as the Issues representing the users agreements.
Each user has to agree to the CLA in the form of an issue on this repository (created by the dfinity-police bot). 

If important rewrites were made that would need all users to review again the document, all [`cla:agreed`](https://github.com/dfinity/cla/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acla%3Aagreed) issues would have to see their cla label replaced by by `cla:invalidated`.

The CLA is asked to be agreed on repositories open to external contributions. In order to open a repository to external contributions you need to send a Pull Request on [repositories-open-to-contributions](https://github.com/dfinity/repositories-open-to-contributions).
